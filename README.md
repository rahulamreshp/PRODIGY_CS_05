# Network Packet Analyzer

The Network Packet Analyzer is a versatile tool designed to intercept and analyze network traffic, providing insights into data transmission, network protocols, and potential security threats. It serves as a valuable resource for network administrators, security professionals, and researchers to monitor and troubleshoot network activity effectively.

# Usage
pip install requirements.txt

python3 NetAnalyzer.py

# Modules

Packet Capture Functionality

1. The program utilizes Scapy, a powerful packet manipulation library, to capture network packets in real-time. It leverages Scapy's sniffing capabilities to intercept packets traversing the network interface.

2. It captures packets across various network protocols, including IP, TCP, UDP, and ICMP, allowing comprehensive analysis of network traffic irrespective of the protocol used.

3. The program filters packets based on specified criteria, such as service protocol (TCP, UDP, ICMP), enabling focused analysis and monitoring of specific types of network traffic.


Packet Analysis and Display

1. Each intercepted packet is dissected and analyzed to extract relevant information, including source and destination IP addresses, protocol type, source and destination ports (if applicable), payload data, and decoding of payload content.

2. The program formats and presents the analyzed packet information in a readable manner, facilitating easy interpretation and understanding of network activity.

3. Special attention is given to decoding payload data, ensuring accurate representation of transmitted data even in encrypted or encoded formats.

4. Packet analysis occurs in real-time, allowing for immediate detection of network anomalies, suspicious activities, or performance issues.


Security and Privacy Considerations

1. While network packet analyzers are indispensable for network monitoring and troubleshooting, their use raises important security and privacy considerations.

2. Users must adhere to legal and ethical guidelines when deploying packet analysis tools, ensuring compliance with applicable laws and regulations governing network monitoring and data privacy.

3. It is essential to use packet analyzers responsibly and transparently, obtaining proper authorization and consent from relevant stakeholders before monitoring network traffic.

4. To mitigate potential risks, users should implement robust security measures to protect access to intercepted packet data and prevent unauthorized use or disclosure of sensitive information. Encryption of captured packet data and secure storage practices are recommended to safeguard confidentiality and integrity.
